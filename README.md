# Bath Algorithm Optimization

This repository contains optimized and non-optimized versions of the Bath algorithm for scientific research and performance comparison purposes.

## Features

- **Optimized with Vectorization and Matrix Operations:** The optimized version of the Bath algorithm leverages vectorization and matrix operations to accelerate computational processing. Calculations are optimized to take advantage of modern hardware features like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and multi-threading.

- **Bath Algorithm Applied to Bat Problem:** The project provides an example of applying the Bath algorithm to a specific problem, such as the bat problem. The accompanying source code includes snippets for the Bath algorithm and sample datasets for illustration.

## Installation

To run the sample code and evaluate performance, install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```
